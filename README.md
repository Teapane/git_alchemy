## GitAlchemy
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) implemented in [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

Git is both a tool I use everyday and something I love to use when developing software. However, some of it is fuzzy. After reading [this awesome blog post](http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/) by [Mary Rose Cook](https://maryrosecook.com/) I became inspired to explore it myself. And since Elixir is the language I have developed a lot of interest in, it seemed like a match made in heaven.

Obviously this is a huge WIP and I wouldn't suggest using it, but hopefully it will grow into something interesting and help me learn more idiomatic elixir as well as git internals.
